4.0.3.6
* explicitly and exclusivly use passive-events in all event-listeners (where using 'preventDefault' is not needed as a part of the functionality anyway). should improve page-performances.
* alternative check for main method 'action' when running from a different JavaScript file ('at_document_end.js'/'at_document_idle.js'), instead of try/catch which slows down performances due to extensive call-stack and prevents discoverying for other thrown errors.

4.0.3.5
+ move logic to a browser-handled async block, by keeping 'action' as normal function, and moving all logic into a secodary 'async function async_action(){____}' block (which returns a promise, which isn't used for now). it simulates an old 'setTimeout(FUNCTION,0)'.

4.0.3.4
* improve engine and use passive-events when possible for mouse/touch related events.

4.0.3.3
* additional repeat main method check, with alarms-api.

4.0.3.2
* cleanup old event-hooks.

4.0.3.1
* improving cross-browser-API compatibility.

4.0.2.4
* using compatible event handler (non-passive).

4.0.2.1
+ added support for Chrome's idle state.
- reduce package size.
- limit re-discovery to once per-page life-cycle state-change (load/ready).

4.0.1.9
* fix engine-loading.

4.0.1.8
+ error handling

4.0.1.7
* engine update with improved id-logic.

4.0.1.5
* extension description update with emoji.

4.0.1.3
+ error-handling.

4.0.1.2
* adding prototyping for browser compatibility.

4.0.1.1
* tag-number updated instead of overriding it.

4.0.0.2
* engine update.

4.0.0.1
* project architecture, support execution on pages with and without JavaScript support, no code-duplication using the scope of the chrome-extension.

3.0.2.2
* Execution start earlier, for heavy pages.

3.0.1.1
* Enhance code-engine.
+ HoverText to Behind-The-Asterisks (Same as my 'old' Firefox-Extension name.. :])

2.1.0.3
* store mouse-hover state as object-oriented attribute instead of HTML element-attribute.

2.1.0.1
- limit mouse enter/leave event, in-favor of in/over.
* always execute main action in friendly non-blocking way.

2.0.3.1
