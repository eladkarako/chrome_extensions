5.0.4.6
* explicitly and exclusivly use passive-events in all event-listeners (where using 'preventDefault' is not needed as a part of the functionality anyway). should improve page-performances.
* alternative check for main method 'action' when running from a different JavaScript file ('at_document_end.js'/'at_document_idle.js'), instead of try/catch which slows down performances due to extensive call-stack and prevents discoverying for other thrown errors.
* reduced hooked events. removed alarm ("timer") code/permissions/background-script loading (file exists but isn't loaded).

5.0.4.5
+ move logic to a browser-handled async block, by keeping 'action' as normal function, and moving all logic into a secodary 'async function async_action(){____}' block (which returns a promise, which isn't used for now). it simulates an old 'setTimeout(FUNCTION,0)'.

5.0.4.4
* slightly more-efficient script-injection-on-timer ("alarm"), although the callback is empty - making sure the last expression on the file always resolves, explicitly, to undefined.

5.0.4.3
* additional repeat main method check, with alarms-api.

5.0.4.2
* cleanup old events-hooks.

5.0.4.1
* holding element-query multi-line string without the use of multiline method.

5.0.3.5
* fix badge not showing in Firefox by allow a better cross-browser-API - use either 'chrome.' (Google syntax) or 'browser.' (Firefox syntax).
+ force restricted variant of JavaScript (strict mode).

5.0.3.3
* improved counter-code.

5.0.3.2
* improved engine, reverting to standard (non-passive) event handler to be compatible with older Chrome versions.
+ adding js-navigation/SPF dynamic page- triggers for main-fix action.

5.0.2.4
+ eBay (and others) tries to disable the autocomplete and spellcheck, adding solutions that will - efficiently and tolerantly - WILL KEEP autocomplete and spellcheck ENABLED :]]

5.0.2.3
+ added support for Chrome's idle state.
- reduced resources size.
- removed re-discovery, now elements will be rediscovered only once per load/ready in page's life-cycle.

5.0.2.2
* improved engine.

5.0.1.3
* improved element-discovery query, to ignore elements hidden by adblocking clients (identified by 'hidden' in-line attribute).

5.0.1.2
* improved element discovery.

5.0.1.1
* remove state flag in-favor of real-state.

5.0.0.1
* handle autocomplete quirks with HTML5 prediction for autocomplete, to favor browser's default behavior.
* clean-up scope.

4.0.7.1
* improved heuristics patterns.
* improved query.

4.0.5.1
+ verbose status, while trying heuristics to resolve attributes repeatedly disabled (first clone than remove attributes than nothing) may stopped anytime both on success by query and on undiscovered success in-loop (really unlikely since query should catch it..) .

4.0.4.1
+ reintroduced event unhook, with regexp to exclude hostnames (for example ones with "*mail*" in-it).

4.0.3.3
* fix engine-loading.

4.0.3.2
+ error handling

4.0.3.1
- removing unhooking functionality for best website-compability.
* improved element-discovery query.

4.0.2.9
* don't unhook event-handles on Google domains.

4.0.2.7
* correct element-count.

4.0.2.6
* improve discovery elements- not hidden elements.
+ adding exception to never unhook-events (in second-phase), based on domain name (for example gmail), to preserve functionality.

4.0.2.5
* improve element-discovery-query, omitting input-types that has no-need for autocomplete/spellcheck (button/file/image/...).
+ improve algorithm's overall-efficiency!

4.0.2.1
* engine update: smart-heuristics for websites that tries to change autocomplete/spellcheck back (such as eBay's onchange in the main-search input element) - resolved by unhooking those events :] -- ha! ha!!

4.0.1.1
* engine update with addressing form-elements too.
* internal upgrade of query assembly.

4.0.0.6
* engine query update, more efficient discovery removing cases where the text-containers are already set ok'ly, and ignore readonly/disabled text containers <sub>(you may download <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jcgjifkfonefkppobfgckphhmaafodoi/">"Enabler"</a> chrome-extension to enable those..)</sub>

4.0.0.5
* engine flag fix

3.0.1.7
* engine fix, for repetition-flag

3.0.1.4
* limit repetition by flag done-elements.

3.0.1.3
+ error handling

3.0.1.2
* adding prototyping for browser compatibility.

3.0.1.1
* tag-number updated instead of overriding it.

3.0.0.1
* project architecture, support execution on pages with and without JavaScript support, no code-duplication using the scope of the chrome-extension.

2.0.0.8
* engine run-state fine tuning.

2.0.0.5
- removing HTTP-headers-modifications and unneeded permissions.

2.0.0.4
+ initial (no versioning while product was in-alpha developing :| ).
