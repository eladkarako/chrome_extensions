1.0.0.7
* pre-checking all reference, to possibly avoid action (if already nullified previously - not needed).

1.0.0.6
* reducing amount of hooked-events and pre-check before some actions to reduce some load.

1.0.0.5
* explicitly and exclusivly use passive-events in all event-listeners (where using 'preventDefault' is not needed as a part of the functionality anyway). should improve page-performances.
* alternative check for main method 'action' when running from a different JavaScript file ('at_document_end.js'/'at_document_idle.js'), instead of try/catch which slows down performances due to extensive call-stack and prevents discoverying for other thrown errors.

1.0.0.4
+ move logic to a browser-handled async block, by keeping 'action' as normal function, and moving all logic into a secodary 'async function async_action(){____}' block (which returns a promise, which isn't used for now). it simulates an old 'setTimeout(FUNCTION,0)'.

1.0.0.3
* improving nullification process with additional reference removing- when possible object reference will be removed not just return undefined.

1.0.0.2
+ initial.
