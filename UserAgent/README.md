<strong>☞︎ UserAgent!</strong>

This web-extension mocks a very old Firefox user-agent both by modifying 
the current frame's (<code>self.userAgent</code>) and 
for every request, before it is sent "outside" to servers making them think you really have this UserAgent.

I personally don't use it as much, 
it does allow you to access a very old/basic version of YouTube, 
which do not use that much ads or at-least uses the ads that are easy to block with uBlock-origin or (other AdBlock).

There is no menu for selecting other UserAgent,
nor there is a option to change the current one used, 
for those, just Google for Firefox: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Faddons.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Ffirefox%2Faddon+user+agent">https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Faddons.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Ffirefox%2Faddon+user+agent</a>
and for Chrome: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fchrome.google.com%2Fwebstore+user+agent">https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fchrome.google.com%2Fwebstore+user+agent</a>.
