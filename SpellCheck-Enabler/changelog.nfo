* clean-up scope.

4.0.7.1
* improved heuristics patterns.
* improved query.

4.0.5.1
+ verbose status, while trying heuristics to resolve attributes repeatedly disabled (first clone than remove attributes than nothing) may stopped anytime both on success by query and on undiscovered success in-loop (really unlikely since query should catch it..) .

4.0.4.1

4.0.2.5
* improve element-discovery-query, omitting input-types that has no-need for autocomplete/spellcheck (button/file/image/...).
+ improve algorithm's overall-efficiency!

4.0.2.1
* engine update: smart-heuristics for websites that tries to change autocomplete/spellcheck back (such as eBay's onchange in the main-search input element) - resolved by unhooking those events :] -- ha! ha!!

4.0.1.1
* engine update with addressing form-elements too.
* internal upgrade of query assembly.

4.0.0.6
* engine query update, more efficient discovery removing cases where the text-containers are already set ok'ly, and ignore readonly/disabled text containers <sub>(you may download <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jcgjifkfonefkppobfgckphhmaafodoi/">"Enabler"</a> chrome-extension to enable those..)</sub>
