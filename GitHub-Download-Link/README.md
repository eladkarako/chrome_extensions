☞︎ raw file view or download, by clicking the file-icon (force download by right-click, save-as..).


Both functionality and making an unused area functional. Nice!  

That file-icon is now your shortcuts to the raw file.  

Right click it and 'Save As...' to save it directly, without viewing it.  
It preserves the original file-name and does not adds '.txt' at the end. Fun!  

Quirks (as a result of the GitHub AJAX navigation/cache):  
- If you do not see the underline under the icon, try hard-reloading the page (<kbd>CTRL<kbd>+<kbd>F5<kbd>).  
- I've tried to force download every-time instead of viewing, but it does not work for GitHub for some reason, so we will enjoy it as a feature (raw view/download by request).
