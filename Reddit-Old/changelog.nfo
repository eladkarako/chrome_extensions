1.0.0.8
+ adding a web-extensio-end redirection using 'webRequest.onBeforeRequest' and 'redirectUrl' replacing just the hostname part from either 'www.reddit.com', 'amp.reddit.com', 'np.reddit.com', or 'reddit.com' to 'old.reddit.com'  --- as long those are main document or an IFRAME-element request. it is far better redirection method than client-side javascript, since it happens really early in the page life-cycle (potentially removing most of the client-side redirection method later..).

1.0.0.7
+ move logic to a browser-handled async block, by keeping 'action' as normal function, and moving all logic into a secodary 'async function async_action(){____}' block (which returns a promise, which isn't used for now). it simulates an old 'setTimeout(FUNCTION,0)'.

1.0.0.6
* more accurate query-resolving-links.

1.0.0.5
* improving regex for link-href.
* fixing regex for location-hostname.

1.0.0.4
* renaming project from 'OldReddit-Fix' to 'Reddit-Old', so visually quicker to be logically related to "reddit", and faster to find.
+ also fix 'amp.reddit.com' (amplify are common subdomain for advertised/promoted redirect-links in search-engines).
* better location.hostname query addressing all www.reddit.com, amp.reddit.com and reddit.com .

1.0.0.3
* fix missing permissions for 'alarms' (setTimeout alternative) - (adding "alarms" and "tabs")

1.0.0.2
+ also fix link-text content for plain-links (no child-elements).

1.0.0.1
+ initial.
