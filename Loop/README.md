<strong>☞︎ Loop-play all video and audio players. Once you start playing, no addition user-interaction required.</strong>

It sets the <code>loop</code> attribute to every video and audio player in the page,  
some players already have inteface for looping the content, some don't,  
this web-extesions will work with all of them.  

YouTube will identify that player will have a <code>loop</code> attribute,  
and you'll be able to see a little check-mark when you'll right click the video-player.

I've basically made this web-extension for myself, and then decided to share it with everyone, because sharing is caring. it's nothing fancy but it is small, quick and it works. If you've enjoyed using it I'll be thrilled to hear all about it in the review section. 

100% free (as beer..), no ads (I hate those!), no cookies, NO data collection, NO analytics, NOT accessing FS, NOT sending or receiving anything and works entirely offline.
