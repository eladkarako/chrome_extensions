1.0.0.6
+ move logic to a browser-handled async block, by keeping 'action' as normal function, and moving all logic into a secodary 'async function async_action(){____}' block (which returns a promise, which isn't used for now). it simulates an old 'setTimeout(FUNCTION,0)'.

1.0.0.5
+ listening both to 'play' and 'playing' to react faster when needed to stop videos.

1.0.0.4
+ resolving interaction custom-skins, measuring user-interaction and removing play-block for actual player that contained somewhere along the path. should be compatible since the mouse/keyboard/touch events are registered passive (so can't be blocked with preventDefault) and in some case or another the root that the interaction will be applied can be the whole page, so either-way the players will be marked as ok on interaction, the case of 'how close' the interaction is not relevent to this case.

1.0.0.3
+ bring back user-interaction check with specific player. listen to interaction event from the player and 3 parent-layers above it. will still be problematic if the the player skin is not DOM-ordered in a way the events can populate up/down from/to eventually reach player. might be a good idea to add some global-page interaction such as scroll and viewport reveal.

1.0.0.2
- removing user-interaction based-functionality.

1.0.0.1
+ initial.
